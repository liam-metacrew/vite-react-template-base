## Introduction

A starter project for [React](https://reactjs.org/) with [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/), [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com),
and [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/). This starter kit is already pre-configured
with [absolute import](https://jsdev.org/env/nodejs/absolute-path-imports/), [React Router](https://reactrouter.com/),
and [other goodies](./package.json). This starter also provides custom authentication
implementation, in the current example is using [GoTrue](https://github.com/netlify/gotrue) from
[Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/). But, you can use any authentication provider or your own.

## Deploy your own

You'll want to fork this repository and deploy your own Next.js website. Once you have an
image generator that sparks joy, you can setup [automatic GitHub](https://vercel.com/github)
deployments so that pushing to master will deploy to production! üöÄ

[![Deploy to Vercel](https://vercel.com/button)](https://vercel.com/new/clone?repository-url=https://github.com/riipandi/vite-react-template&project-name=vite-react-template&repo-name=my-vite-react-app&env=VITE_GOTRUE_URL)
[![Deploy to Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/img/deploy/button.svg)](https://app.netlify.com/start/deploy?repository=https://github.com/riipandi/vite-react-template)

#### Cloudflare Deployment

You need to add `NODE_VERSION` with value `18.17.1` or `20.9.0` on the environment variables setting.
Visit [Cloudflare pages docs](https://developers.cloudflare.com/pages/platform/build-configuration/)
for more information.

For the preview branch:

```env
VITE_PUBLIC_SITE_URL=${CF_PAGES_URL}
```

## Development

This project uses TypeScript for type checking, [ESLint](https://eslint.org/) for linting which
is configured in `.eslintrc.js`, and [Prettier](https://prettier.io/) for auto-formatting in
this project. It's recommended to get TypeScript set up for your editor and install an editor
plugin (like the [VSCode Prettier plugin](https://s.id/vscode-prettier)) to get auto-formatting
on saving and get a really great in-editor experience with type checking and auto-complete.
